                to attempt to resolve any Disputes by negotiation with the other party (by
                phone, electronic correspondence, or written correspondence). If we are

                below.

                <b>Binding Arbitration</b>. If you and Rapptr Labs are unable to resolve a
                Dispute through informal negotiations, either you or Rapptr Labs may elect
                to have the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below)
                finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. Any election to
                arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other. The
                arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial
                Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“<b>AAA</b>”)
                and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer
                Related Disputes (“
                <b>AAA Consumer Rules</b>”) both of which are available at the AAA
                website, www.adr.org. The determination of whether a Dispute is subject to
                arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and
                determined by a court rather than an arbitrator. Your arbitration fees and
                your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules
                and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. The arbitration
                may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone
                or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing but need not
                provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. The arbitrator
                must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the
                arbitrator fails to do so. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement
                you and Rapptr Labs may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay
                proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter
                judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.

                determined by a court of law or by a jury and any right that you may have
                under Article 13 of the State Bar Act, where applicable, to have a trial

                bond), specific performance, or other equitable relief without prejudice
